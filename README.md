Python ip scan tool using multiprocessing

This little tool has come about because of my dive into learning more about multiprocessing and multithreading in python.

There is more that I would like to add onto this. Like the ability to also see how many threads are avaiable and allow the user to pick between cores, threads, or both to see a time differance.

The current setup ofcourse only works for teh /24 ip range. I would like to try an make it a little bit more flexable.
